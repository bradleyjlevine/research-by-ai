## Recommended Architecture

### Core Technology Stack

**Storage & Table Format:**
- **Apache Iceberg** as the universal table format - provides ACID transactions, schema evolution, and multi-engine compatibility
- **Object Storage** with lifecycle policies (S3, Azure Blob, GCS) for automatic tiering
- **MinIO** for hybrid/on-premise components where needed

**Query & Processing Layer:**
- **Trino** (formerly PrestoSQL) as the federated query engine - can query across all clouds without data movement
- **Apache Spark** for ETL/ELT workloads, deployable on any cloud platform
- **Apache Polaris** or **Nessie** for versioned metadata catalog management

### Multi-Cloud Strategy

**Regional Data Hubs Approach:**
1. Deploy data collection and initial processing in each cloud region where data originates
2. Keep primary data in the cloud where it's generated to minimize egress costs
3. Replicate only metadata and search indexes to a central location
4. Use Iceberg's metadata layer for federated queries across clouds

### Cost Optimization Features

**Storage Tiering:**
- Hot data (0-30 days): Standard storage
- Warm data (30-90 days): Infrequent access storage  
- Cold data (90+ days): Archive storage
- Long-term (1+ years): Deep archive storage

**Compute Optimization:**
- Spot instances for non-critical batch processing (50-90% savings)
- Auto-scaling query engines based on demand
- Serverless options where available (AWS Athena, Azure Synapse Serverless)

## Key Vendor Solutions to Consider

### Open Source Foundation (Most Cost-Effective)
- **Cost Impact:** 50-70% savings vs pure SaaS solutions
- **Components:** Apache Iceberg + Trino + Object Storage + Nessie
- **Trade-off:** Higher engineering effort, maximum flexibility

   - Direct BigQuery integration for analytics

5. **AWS Lake Formation + Athena** with Iceberg tables
   - Serverless query engine with pay-per-query model
   - Native Iceberg support for time travel and ACID transactions

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
- Deploy Apache Iceberg with object storage in primary cloud
- Set up Trino for federated queries
- Implement basic data ingestion pipelines
- Establish governance and security policies

### Phase 2: Multi-Cloud Extension (Months 4-6)
- Deploy regional data hubs in additional clouds
- Set up cross-cloud metadata synchronization
- Implement federated authentication/authorization
- Add search indexing capabilities

### Phase 3: Optimization (Months 7-12)
- Implement advanced caching strategies
- Add ML-driven data placement optimization
- Deploy advanced analytics tools
- Implement automated cost monitoring

## Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Data Placement:** Keep data close to compute to minimize egress charges
2. **Query Optimization:** Use columnar formats (Parquet) with intelligent partitioning
3. **Caching:** Implement query result caching to reduce redundant compute
4. **Compression:** Use efficient compression algorithms at the Iceberg table level
5. **Resource Management:** Automatic scaling and spot instance utilization

## Key Benefits of This Approach

- **Cost Reduction:** 50-70% savings compared to pure SaaS solutions
- **Vendor Independence:** Open standards prevent lock-in
- **Multi-Cloud Native:** Designed for cross-cloud data federation
- **Future-Proof:** Built on open standards with wide industry adoption
- **Scalable:** Handles petabyte-scale datasets with years of retention
